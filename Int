1. What is difference between for loop and while loop in python?
A. The for statement iterates through a collection or iterable object
   or generator function. The while statement simply loops until a condition
   is False.

2. How to exit from the loop?
A. Using break keyword. we can exit from the loop if condition satisfy. you can
   skip unnecessary iteration from loop by using break statement.

3. How to skip some iteration from the loop?
A. you can skip unnecessary iteration from loop by using break statement.

4. When else part will be executed in loop?
A. The else clause is executed when the for loop terminates after the
   exhaustion of the iterable.(iterate all values then else part execute)

5. How to iterate backward? E.g to print upto 6.Like 6,5,4,3,2,1.
A. By using range() we can iterate backword.
   for i in range(6,1):
        print(i)

6.How we can iterate backward on list?
A. list1=[1,2,3,4,5]
   for i in range(len(list1),0,-1):
        print(i)
Dict:
1. How to create dictionary?
A. dictionary={"a":1,"b":2}

2. How to access data from dictionary? Key, value and both.
A. d={"a":1,"b":2,"c":3,"d1":{"x":12,"y":13}}
x=d.fromkeys("c",3)
print(x)
for i in d.keys():
    print("Keys",i)
for i in d.values():
    print("Values",i)
for i in d.items():
    print(i)
output:
('a', 1)
('b', 2)
('c', 3)
('d1', {'x': 12, 'y': 13})
#convert sequence to dict
# seq = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'}
# li=["apple","banana","orange"]
# res=dict.fromkeys(li,"fruits")
# print(str(res))
# output :{'apple': 'fruits', 'banana': 'fruits', 'orange': 'fruits'}

3. How to delete element from dictionary?
A. by using del keyword,
   by using pop()
   by using popitem()

4. What is purpose of get(), update(), setdefault() methods of dictionary?
A. i)get() method accept key as 1 parameter return the value of the key.
   ii)update() method accept iterable parameter or key-value pair update existing
   dictionary.and update the existing keys value.
   iii)
5. Write a program to find number of occurences of each character of each letter present in the
given string?
File handling:
1. Write a program to check whether the given file exist or not. If it is available then print its
content?
2. Write a function in Python to count and display the total number of words in a text file.
3. Write a function in Python to read lines from a text file. Your function should find and display
the occurrence of the word "the"
4. Write a function in Python to count uppercase character in a text file.
5. Write a function in Python to count words in a text file those are ending with alphabet "e".
General:
1. What are types of arguments?
2. What is decorator? Write a decorator to display function name and print start and end.
3. What is generator? Explain advantages. Write a generator for Fibonacci series.
4. What is difference between shallow copy and deepcopy?
5. How exception handling work in python?
Very Important Programs:
1. Write a python program for count character from string after each character is changed.
e.g. input = 'aaaabahhhhhaaa' output = a4b1a1h5a3
2. You have a list of N+1 integers between 1 and N. You know thereâ€™s at least one duplicate,
but there might be more. For example, if N=3, your list might be 3, 1, 1, 3 or it might be 1, 3, 2, 2
Print out a number that appears in the list more than once.
